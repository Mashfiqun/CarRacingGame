Car Racing Game

There are two player controlled cars, one controlled by WASD and the other controlled by the arrow keys. The cars will have a constant speed but there will be random powerups on the track to consume which will increase the speed for some seconds. The cars themselves can spawn debuffs that would hurt their speed whenever one consumes it. A few random obstacles will be spawned that will block the cars path. Collision detection makes sure the cars cannot pass through each other and cannot go beyond the track boundaries. The first car to complete 3 laps wins. There is a menu to start or exit the game. The cars can randomly teleport every 15 seconds.
